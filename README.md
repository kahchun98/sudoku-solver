# Sudoku solver using backtracking algorithm
Simple sudoku solver that uses [backtracking algorithm] (https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/backtracking-algorithms/). This is a great example of how backtracking algorithm can solve [Constraint Satisfaction Problems] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constraint_satisfaction_problem).

# Credits
I stumbled upon this question on Leetcode and adapted the code from this [post] (https://leetcode.com/problems/sudoku-solver/discuss/15752/Straight-Forward-Java-Solution-Using-Backtracking).
